# Pomodoro app decision

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2022-12-02

## Context and Problem Statement

Productivity is much harder to track in remote work environments. As many companies move towards remote work, a major problem is becoming team members losing touch with each other and losing touch with what their peers are working on. This productivity tracking app is basically a pomodoro timer will solve this problem by making it fun to “post” what you’re working on. The only way to “post” on this social media app is by working.

## Considered Options

* Personal workspace
* quiz app / iclicker replacement
* personal blog platform
* second hand trading application
* pomodoro app

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "pomodoro app", because would be simplest to implement and we would all like to use this app.
