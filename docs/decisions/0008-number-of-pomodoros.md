# Number of Pomodoros

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2022-12-02

## Context and Problem Statement

Should the number of pomodoros in a session be limited or unlimited? After doing some research and reading the original pomodoro book we learned a lot about the technique and the intended outcomes and benefits which informed our decisions.

## Considered Options

* unlimited number
* one at a time
* 4-5 pomodoros

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "4-5 pomodoros", because the pomodoro technique states that it is most productive to complete 4-5 pomo's and then take a longer break.
