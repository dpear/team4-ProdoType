## Problem Statement

Itâ€™s really hard to sometime get started with the task at hand. There can be multiple reasons for it.

1. Cold start.
2. Distractions.
3. Procastination etc.

## Proposed Solution

We are creating a chrome extension contaning a pomodoro timer enhanced with a to-do list creation functionality.

The **Pomodoro Technique** helps you resist all of those self-interruptions and re-train your brains to focus. Each pomodoro is dedicated to one task and each break is a chance to reset and bring your attention back to what you should be working on.

The Pomodoro Technique focuses on breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. Ultimately, it allows you to focus better and spread out your productivity levels throughout the day.
